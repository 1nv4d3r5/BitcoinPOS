{"name":"Bitcoin POS","tagline":"","body":"ANNOUNCEMENT\r\n============\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.\r\n\r\nI will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.\r\n\r\nIt is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.\r\n\r\nBTC: [1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx](bitcoin:1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx) | TRC: [1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG](terracoin:1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG) | LTC: [LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5](litecoin:LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5)\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWelcome to Bitcoin POS!\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nMy name is [Antony Bailey](http://www.antonybailey.net) and I'll be your author for today.\r\n\r\nThe system is **still** under development, in fact it's only just started.\r\n\r\nWell let's begin. I originally decided to start on a [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) Point of Sale management to work with [Blockchain.info](http://www.blockchain.info) and then I came to realise it would be a better plan to make a completely intergrated [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) node with the features needed.\r\n\r\nThe features of the system are:\r\n\r\n*   Connection to Bitcoin Network\r\n*   Full Node with local Blockchain\r\n*   Wallet Backup\r\n*   Wallet Encryption\r\n*   Unique Address per Transaction\r\n*   QR Code Generation\r\n*   Sweep Private Keys\r\n*   [Mt.Gox](http://www.mtgox.com) Price Ticker\r\n*   Customer CRM\r\n*   Products Database\r\n*   Stock Control\r\n*   Customer Export\r\n*   Product Export\r\n*   Sales Export\r\n\r\nThird Party Libaries:\r\n\r\n- [BitcoinSharp](http://nuget.org/packages/BitCoinSharp/)\r\n- [Entity Framework 5.0](http://nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/5.0.0)\r\n- [BouncyCastle Crypto](http://nuget.org/packages/BouncyCastle/)\r\n\t\r\nSupport:\r\nObviously this is free software, as is the [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) protocol. I am developing this in my own time and am not being paid to do so. I will gladly accept donations, to my Bitcoin address.\r\n\r\nBitcoin: [14hSGGYXa85UbjryvkdMFKwJe3McFi6Ww9](http://bitcoin:14hSGGYXa85UbjryvkdMFKwJe3McFi6Ww9)\r\n\r\n![qrcode][qrcode]\r\n[qrcode]:https://blockchain.info/qr?data=14hSGGYXa85UbjryvkdMFKwJe3McFi6Ww9&size=200\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who sent me ![balance][balance].\r\n[balance]:http://bitcoinbox.ru/display/graph.php?btcaddress=14hSGGYXa85UbjryvkdMFKwJe3McFi6Ww9","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
