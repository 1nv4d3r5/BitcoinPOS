Welcome to Bitcoin POS!

My name is Antony and I'll be your author for today.

The system is still under development, in fact it's only just started.

Well let's begin. I originally decided to start on a Bitcoin Point of Sale management to work with Blockchain.info and then I came to realise it would be a better plan to make a completely intergrated Bitcoin node with the features needed.

The features of the system are:
	- Connection to Bitcoin Network
	- Full Node with local Blockchain
	- Wallet Backup
	- Wallet Encryption
	- Unique Address per Transaction
	- QR Code Generation
	- Sweep Private Keys
	- Mt.Gox Price Ticker
	- Customer CRM
	- Products Database
	- Stock Control
	- Customer Export
	- Product Export
	- Sales Export

Third Party Libaries:
	- BitcoinSharp
	- Entity Framework 5.0
	- BouncyCastle Crypto
	
Support:
Obviously this is free software, as is the Bitcoin protocol. I am developing this in my own time and am not being paid to do so. I will gladly accept donations, to my Bitcoin address.
