Welcome to Bitcoin POS!
-----------------------

The system is **still** under development, in fact it's only just started.

Well let's begin. I originally decided to start on a [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) Point of Sale management to work with [Blockchain.info](http://www.blockchain.info) and then I came to realise it would be a better plan to make a completely intergrated [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) node with the features needed.

The features of the system are:

*   Connection to Bitcoin Network
*   Full Node with local Blockchain
*   Wallet Backup
*   Wallet Encryption
*   Unique Address per Transaction
*   QR Code Generation
*   Sweep Private Keys
*   [Mt.Gox](http://www.mtgox.com) Price Ticker
*   Customer CRM
*   Products Database
*   Stock Control
*   Customer Export
*   Product Export
*   Sales Export

Third Party Libaries:

- [BitcoinSharp](http://nuget.org/packages/BitCoinSharp/)
- [Entity Framework 5.0](http://nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/5.0.0)
- [BouncyCastle Crypto](http://nuget.org/packages/BouncyCastle/)
	
Support:
Obviously this is free software, as is the [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) protocol. I am developing this in my own time and am not being paid to do so. I will gladly accept donations, to my Bitcoin address.
